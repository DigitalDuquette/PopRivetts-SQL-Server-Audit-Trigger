# Audit Trigger for SQL Server

The most widely distributed audit trigger for SQL Server complete with all the suggested changes from Stack Overflow.

## Why does this repo exist?

I didn't write this code. I'm standing on the shoulder of giants. The code contained in this repo takes all suggested changes from [Pop Rivettâ€™s audit trail trigger](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/sql-server/database-administration-sql-server/pop-rivetts-sql-server-faq-no-5-pop-on-the-audit-trail/).  

When the audit code stopped working I found the following discussions:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19737723/log-record-changes-in-sql-server-in-an-audit-table
* https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/34774768#34774768 
    * http://jsbin.com/lafayiluri/1/edit?html,output 

I've taken all of the source code here and combined into a single repo for my use. Hopefully this will provide an easy copy/paste for others in the future.
